# Task-1: Image denoise and filtering:
The face image with class of uint8 is converted to greyscale then resized to 512 x512 resolution. Original image, image with Gaussian noise (zero means & 10 standard variation) and salt and pepper noise (density 0.1) are shown. Noise is added by using Matlab built-in function imnoise. Notice since the image is in uint8 class and imnoise function converts uint8 values to doubles before applying the variance, so the standard deviation of Gaussian need to be scaled down by 255. 

# DEEP LEARNING PLATFORM ON UBUNTU 14.04 LTS - Tensorflow on GPU
* AUTHOR:Ruoxiang Wen

## Reasons for this config
* gcc version 4.8 comes with ubuntu 14.04. However on ubuntu 16.04 the gcc version is 5.4. CUDA 8.0 can be installed using gcc 5.4 complier, but currently many deep learning libraries do not support CUDA 8.0. SO it is better to downgrade to ubuntu 14.04 to avoid problems (based on my experience of installation on ubuntu 16.04)

## Updata your system

###### First, open a terminal and run the following commands to make sure your OS is up-to-date:
