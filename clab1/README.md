#Task-1: Image denoise and filtering:
The face image with class of uint8 is converted to greyscale then resized to 512 x512 resolution. Original image, image with Gaussian noise (zero means & 10 standard variation) and salt and pepper noise (density 0.1) are shown. Noise is added by using Matlab built-in function imnoise. Notice since the image is in uint8 class and imnoise function converts uint8 values to doubles before applying the variance, so the standard deviation of Gaussian need to be scaled down by 255. 
After that, 9 x 9 Gaussian filter is implemented. To create consistent image after convolution, the borders of original image is mirror-reflected to extend the image. Then a 9 x 9 kernel of Gaussian filter is created using fspecial function. Finally, a function called img_Gauss_filter is created to perform the convolution. The resulting image under sigma 1, 5, and 9 are compared in figure on the left hand side. The signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) increased from 40.3 to 44.1 when sigma change from 1 to 5, after that increasing sigma has little effect on the SNR.
